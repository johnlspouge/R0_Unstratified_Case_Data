README

Code is written in Python (except the CentOS executable ‘arrp.exe’, discussed below).
Installation of the appropriate Python packages is assumed.

This current working directory contains:
    (1) This file README
    (2) The directory Pipeline/

Pipeline/ contains:
    (1) make.log: log file monitoring STDERR and overwritten when ‘make.py’ executes
    (2) make.py: Python makefile
        a. executes with the command ‘python make.py’
        b. drives the Python make files for the subdirectories in Pipeline/:
            i. 1_Prem_Matrices_to_df/
            ii. 2_ARRP/
            iii. 3_Prem_Matrices_to_PF_Eigenvalue/
            iv. 4_R0_ARRP/

Pipeline/ subdirectories for a pipeline step all have a common structure:
    (1) Data/: [optional] files from the Internet for the step
        Data/ and its input files are never touched.
    (2) Executable/: contains the Python makefile and executables
        Trace execution by examining the makefile in Executable/.
    (3) Output/: contains output from Executable/ files
        Later steps may use the output files as input files.

Pipeline/ subdirectories:
    (1) 1_Prem_Matrices_to_df/
        a. Data/
            i. MUestimates_all_locations_1.json
            ii. MUestimates_all_locations_2.json
            iii. UNSDMethodology.csv
        b. Output/
            i. [3-letter UN ISO 3166 country code].csv
    (2) 2_ARRP/
        a. Data/
            i. owid-covid-data.json
        b. Executable/ : contains the usual Python makefile and executables
            i. The file ‘arrp.exe’ is a C++ CentOS executable.
            ii. C++ files for compilation on other systems can be found at https://tinyurl.com/spouge-arrp
        c. Output/
            i. ‘slope.csv’ has a single tab with several headings, 
            some of which are:
                1. slope = semi-log slope base e
                2. error = standard deviation in estimate slope
                3. start_date = first day with 30 or more smoothed cases
                4. end_date = the day before either no data or less than 1 smoothed case
                5. number_of_points = end_date – start_date + 1
            ii. Countries/
                1. [3-letter UN ISO 3166 country code].dat data file
                2. [3-letter UN ISO 3166 country code].out output files
                Each file corresponds to a country whose data permits ‘arrp.exe’ regime regression.
    (3) 3_Prem_Matrices_to_PF_Eigenvalue/
        a. Data/ not present
            1_Prem_Matrices_to_df/Output/ provides the input.
        b. Output/
            i. ‘pf_eigenvalue.csv’ has a single tab with several headings:
                1. “pf_eigenvalue” = Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of full Prem contact matrix
                2. “pf_eigenvalue[0…i]”  = eigenvalue of Prem contact matrix with rows and columns {0,1,…,i} deleted. 
                    i = 0,1,…,7 corresponds to deleting age-groups up to 5,10,…,40 years old.
    (4) 4_R0_ARRP/
        a. Data/ 
            i. ‘generation_time.json’ provides the parameters for gamma distribution of the generation time.
        b. Output/
            i. ‘pf_eigenvalue.csv’ has a single tab with several headings:
                1. “pf_eigenvalue” = Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of full Prem contact matrix
                2. “pf_eigenvalue[0…i]”  = eigenvalue of Prem contact matrix with rows and columns {0,1,…,i} deleted.
                3. i = 0,1,…,7; i.e., age-groups up to 5,10,…,40 years old deleted.
